This theme uses bundler (http://bundler.io) for maintaining the used
ruby gem files of sass and compass in versions that are not the latest any more.

Please first run

```bundle install```

and then use

```bundle exec [compass compile]```

instead of ```compass compile``` only.

The latest tested versions are:  
- for sass 3.2.14  
- for compass 0.12.3
